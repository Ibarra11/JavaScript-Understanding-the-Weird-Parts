Types in JavaScript

    Dynamic Typing
        You dont tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures
        during execution.  The value a variable can hold can change over time.

    Static Typing
        You tell the complier what type of data it should expect This
        variable ahead of time.


Primitive Types

    an object.  An object is a collection of name value pairs.

    There a 6 primitive types in JavaScript

        sets variables to undefined by default;
        null: a variable that has not been given a value and we set it to null
        boolean: true or false value
        number: There is only one type of number in JS, which is floating point
        string: an array of characters or sequence or characters and both single
        quotes or double quotes to represent a string
        symbol: used in ES6 


Operators
